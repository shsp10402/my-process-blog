# Situation
I established and finish testing on local, but when I prepare to upload and run it on github, many errors appear.

# Action
I copied the error message and sent it to Gemini, he asked me to check the documents and setting. After I make sure everything went well, he asked me to check the status of github.

# Result
I check it and found it broke. Next time, I would check the status of website first if lots of error informations come out.
